System Model
------------
In a practical network system, users' service requests continuously arrive at the underlying infrastructure.

- **Physical Network**: Underlying infrastructure is virtualized as a physical network
- **Virtual Network**: User service requests are virtualized as virtual networks

   Physical Network
   ^^^

   The physical network is modelled as a undirected graph :math:`G^p=(N^p, L^p)`, where

   - :math:`N^p` is the set of physical nodes. Each physical node :math:`n^p \in N^p` has a set of computing resources, such as CPU, GPU memory, and bandwidth, which are represented as a vector :math:`C(n^p)`.
   - :math:`L^p` is the set of physical links. Each physical link :math:`l^p \in L^p` has a bandwidth capacity :math:`B(l^p)`.

   :class-card: sd-outline-info  sd-rounded-1
   :class-footer: sd-font-weight-bold

   Virtual Network
   ^^^

   Each virtual network is modelled as a undirected graph :math:`G^v=(N^v, L^v, d^v)`, where

   - :math:`N^v` is the set of virtual nodes. Each virtual node :math:`n^v \in N^v` has a set of resource requirements, such as CPU, GPU memory, and bandwidth, which are represented as a vector :math:`R(n^v)`.
   - :math:`L^v` is the set of virtual links. Each virtual link :math:`l^v \in L^v` has a bandwidth requirement :math:`B(l^v)`.
   - :math:`d^v` is the lifetime of the user service request. Once the VNR is accepted, it will be maintained for :math:`d^v` time slots.


Mapping Process
---------------

The mapping process aims to map the virtual nodes and links onto the substrate network with minimal resource cost while satisfying various QoS constraints.

This graph mapping process :math:`f: G^v \rightarrow G^p` can be divided into two subproblems: node mapping and link mapping.

   :class-card: sd-outline-primary  sd-rounded-1
   :class-footer: sd-font-weight-bold

   Node Mapping :math:`f_n: N^v \rightarrow N^p`
   ^^^

   Node mapping involves assigning each virtual node :math:`n^v \in N^v` to a physical node :math:`n^p \in N^p`.

   In this process, the following constraints should be satisfied:

   - **One-to-one mapping constraints**: Each virtual node should be mapped to exactly one substrate node.

   .. math::
       :label: formulation-eq-node-1

       f_n(n^v) = n^p, \quad \forall n^v \in N^v

   - **Computing Resource Availability**: The computing resources required by the virtual node should be available on the physical node.

   .. math::
       :label: formulation-eq-node-2

       C(n^p) \geq C(n^v), \quad \forall n^v \in N^v, n^p = f_n(n^v)

   :class-header: sd-bg-primary  sd-text-white sd-font-weight-bold
   :class-card: sd-outline-primary  sd-rounded-1
   :class-footer: sd-font-weight-bold

   Link Mapping :math:`f_l: L^v \rightarrow P^p`
   ^^^

   Link mapping involves finding a physical path :math:`p^p \in P^p` for each virtual link :math:`l^v \in L^v`.

   In this process, the following constraints should be satisfied:
    
   - **Link-to-path mapping constraint**: Each virtual link can only be mapped to a path consisting of physical links.
   
   .. math::
       :label: formulation-eq-link-1

       f_l(l^v) = p^p \{l^p_1, l^p_2, \ldots, l^p_k\}, \quad \forall l^v \in L^v

   - **Connectivity constraints**: The mapping should preserve the connectivity of the virtual network, i.e., if there is a virtual link between two virtual nodes, the corresponding physical nodes should be connected by a physical link.

   .. math::
       :label: formulation-eq-link-2

         f_n(n^v_1) = n^p_1, f_n(n^v_2) = n^p_2 \Rightarrow \exists l^p \in L^p, f_l(l^v) = l^p, \quad \forall l^v = (n^v_1, n^v_2) \in L^v


   - **Link resource constraint**:  The sum of the bandwidth requirements of the virtual links mapped to a physical link cannot exceed its capacity.
   
   .. math::
       :label: formulation-eq-link-3

       \sum_{l^v \in L^v, f_l(l^v) = l^p} B(l^v) \leq B(l^p), \quad \forall l^p \in L^p


Evaluation Metric
-----------------

The performance of the mapping process is evaluated based on two types of key metrics from the perspectives of network provider and users.

   Resource Efficiency
   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

   For the network provider, they aim to maximize the revenue generated by the accepted virtual network requests while minimizing the cost incurred by the mapped virtual networks.

   - **Total Revenue**

   The total revenue measures the obtained revenue of the network provider.
   It is defined as the sum of the revenue generated by the accepted virtual network requests.
   The revenue for a single virtual network is defined as follows:

   .. math::
       :label: formulation-eq-resource-2

       \text{Rev}(G^{v}, t) =\begin{cases} \displaystyle\sum_{n^v \in N^v} \text{Rev}(n^v) + \displaystyle\sum_{l^v \in L^v} \text{Rev}(l^v), & \text{if} \ G^{v} \ \text{is accepted}, \\0, & \text{otherwise}\end{cases}
   
   Therefore, the total revenue for virtual networks is defined as follows:

   .. math::
       :label: formulation-eq-resource-5

       \text{TotalRev}(G^{v},t) =\sum_{t=0}^{T}\text{Rev}(G^{V},t )
   
   where :math:`\text{Rev}(n^v)` and :math:`\text{Rev}(l^v)` are the revenue generated by the virtual node and link, respectively. :math:`T` is the end time of all virtual network requests.

   - **Total Cost**

   The total cost measures the cost incurred by the network provider.
   It is defined as the sum of the cost incurred by the mapped virtual networks.
   The cost for a single virtual network is defined as follows:

   .. math::
       :label: formulation-eq-resource-6

       \text{Cost}(G^{v}, t) = \sum_{n^v \in N^v} \text{Cost}(n^v) + \sum_{l^v \in L^v} \text{Cost}(l^v)
   
   Therefore, the total cost for virtual networks is defined as follows:

   .. math::
       :label: formulation-eq-resource-4

       \text{TotalCost}(G^{v},t) = \sum_{t=0}^{T}\text{Cost}(G^{v}, t)

   where :math:`\text{Cost}(n^v)` and :math:`\text{Cost}(l^v)` are the cost incurred by the virtual node and link, respectively. :math:`T` is the end time of all virtual network requests.


   - **Revenue-to-Cost Ratio**

   The revenue-to-cost ratio measures the efficiency of the network provider in generating revenue while minimizing the cost.
   It is defined as the ratio of the total revenue to the total cost incurred by the mapped virtual networks.

   .. math::
       :label: formulation-eq-resource-3

       \text{Revenue-to-Cost Ratio} = \lim_{T \to \infty}\frac{\text{TotalRev}(G^{v},t)}{\text{TotalCost}(G^{v},t)}

   - **Resource Utilization**

   The resource utilization measures the efficiency of resource usage in the physical network.
   It is defined as the ratio of the total resources used by the mapped virtual networks to the total resources available in the physical network.
   The resources used by the virtual network can be expressed as:
   
   .. math::
       :label: formulation-eq-resource-7

       \text{VirResource}(G^{v},t) = \sum_{n^v \in N^v} R(n^v) + \sum_{l^v \in L^v} B(l^v)
   
   The total available resources of the physical network are represented asï¼š
   
   .. math::
       :label: formulation-eq-resource-8

       \text{PhyResource}(G^{p}) = \sum_{n^p \in N^p} C(n^p) + \sum_{l^p \in L^p} B(l^p)

   Therefore, the formula for resource utilization is as follows:

   .. math::
       :label: formulation-eq-resource-1

       \text{Resource Utilization} = \lim_{T \to \infty}\frac{\sum_{t=0}^{T}\text{VirResource}(G^{v},t)}{\text{PhyResource}(G^{p})}

   :class-card: sd-outline-success  sd-rounded-1
   :class-footer: sd-font-weight-bold

   QoS Satisfaction
   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

   For the network users, they aim to ensure that their service requests are satisfied with the desired QoS requirements.

   - **Acceptance Ratio**

   The acceptance ratio measures the percentage of accepted virtual network requests among all incoming requests.
   It is defined as the ratio of the number of accepted virtual network requests to the total number of incoming requests.

   .. math::
       :label: formulation-eq-qos-1

       \text{Acceptance Ratio} = \lim_{T \to \infty}\frac{\sum_{t=0}^{T}\text{AcpReq}(G^{v},t)}{\sum_{t=0}^{T}\text{TolReq}(G^{p},t)}

   where :math:`\text{AcpReq}(G^{v},t)` is the number of VNRs accepted at time t and the number of accepted requests is determined based on the resource availability and QoS constraints.

   - **QoS Violation Ratio**

   The QoS violation ratio quantifies the percentage of VNRs that fail to meet the QoS constraints.
   It is defined as the ratio of the number of violated requests to the total number of requests.

   .. math::
       :label: formulation-eq-qos-2

       \text{QoS Violation Ratio} = \lim_{T \to \infty}\frac{\sum_{t=0}^{T}\text{VioReq}(G^{v},t)}{\sum_{t=0}^{T}\text{TolReq}(G^{p},t)}

   where :math:`\text{VioReq}(G^{v}, t)` is the number of violated requests at time t and the number of violated requests is determined based on the QoS constraints.
