Virne: A Simulator for NFV-RA
===================================

.. note::

  **Virne** is still under development. 
  If you have any questions, 
  please open an new issue on `Github <https://github.com/GeminiLight/virne>`_  or 
  contact me via email: wtfly2018@gmail.com.


**Virne** is a simulator designed to address **resource allocation problems in network function virtualization**. This category of problems is often referred to by various names, including:

- **Virtual Network Embedding (VNE)**
- **Virtual Network Function Placement (VNF Placement)**
- **Service Function Chain Deployment (SFC Deployment)**
- **Network Slicing**

The main goal of Virne is to provide a unified and flexible framework for solving these problems. Its main characteristics are as follows.

        Light-Weight
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^
        Implement concisely with less necessary dependencies, and can be extended easily for specific algorithms.
